Last class Dr.Bradshaw pulled out some really sweet animations.  They where absolutely mind blowing.  But how could anybody make something so amazing, the secret lies in the code, transition() is how this process is started as it starts some sort of change with the data and controls how long it takes and how it starts.  The other piece of code that must be known is behaviours which allow for more ways to start functions while code is running.  Some of these things are on click or mouse over allowing for more interactive data to be used or accessed in varying ways.  Now we know how to begin coding with animations.
